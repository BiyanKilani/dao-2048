# 2048

2048 is a number puzzle game. When the squares of the same number are merged together, they will add up. Each round will have an extra square with 2 or 4 written on it, and the game ends when the square cannot be moved. Players have to find a way to make up a square with **2048** (or larger) in this small 16 squares.
